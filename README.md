# ~~Awesome Claude Code Agents~~

# A List of Claude Code Agents

This is a list of resources for Claude Code Agents - Initially I hoped to be able to maintain an "awesome-list" with the same level of care and attention that I give to [Awesome Claude Code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code), but currently it's unfeasible, and I don't inend to be a repo-name-squatter, so I've changed the name - I'm happy to share things if people want to submit resources, this already has a small but non-trivial number of stars, but I want to make clear that this is not a curated list, as things currently stand. (Which is not to say these are not very fine resources.)

### Agents

### Agent Frameworks

[`Code By Agents`](https://github.com/baryhuang/code-by-agents) by [Bary Huange](https://github.com/baryhuang)  
An orchestration framework for designing and coordinating Claude Code agents, with a very clean interface, and sophisticated orchestration logic. (I think this might possibly involve a hand-rolled agent framework, given the committerdates, so that's pretty amazing.)

[`awesome-claude-agents`](https://github.com/rahulvrane/awesome-claude-agents) by [Rahul Rane](https://github.com/rahulvrane)
A _slightly_ similar repository 😉 to the present one with a growing list of awesome agents for Claude Code.

[`EquilateralAgents Open Core`](https://github.com/Equilateral-AI/equilateral-agents-open-core) by [HappyHippo.ai](https://github.com/Equilateral-AI)
22 self-learning AI agents with memory and community standards contribution. Features agent memory (tracks last 100 executions), pattern recognition, and workflow optimization for security, quality, deployment, and compliance.

[`Claude Code Subagents Collection`](https://github.com/wshobson/agents?tab=re) by [Seth Hobson](https://github.com/wshobson).
A pretty impressive resource with _dozens_ of awesome-looking agents that I haven't even had time to explore yet, but clearly this gentleman has put a lot of work into this feature that's been out for one freaking day at the time of writing!

## Contributing

See notice at top - I'm happy to share any resources that are not obviously malicious - so feel free to just submit a PR against the README and make sure it fits the format. This repo is "passively" maintained, let's say, which is why I've "relinquished" the "awesome"-title to someone who has the capacity for active maintainance.

If you are interested in being a collaborator on this list, in order to make it an actively maintained list, you may feel free to contact me (see my profile page), but given the fact that the star count is fairly modest, and therefore there is no blocker to starting your own list, be forewarned that I may be suspicious of attention-seekers.
